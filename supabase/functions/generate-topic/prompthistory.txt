Your task is to first decide between generating High Engagement or SEO-focused titles. Before generating titles, choose one of two distinct paths:

1. **High Engagement (Buzzfeed-style)**:
   - Use emotional, intriguing, or provocative language to encourage clicks.
   - Incorporate listicles, surprising facts, intriguing questions, or career tips.
   - Limit list numbers between 3 and 7.
   - Include timely references or trending topics when possible.
   - Mix various compelling title formats including:
     * Intriguing questions (e.g., \"Is Your Radiology Career Future-Proof?\")
     * \"Secrets\" or \"things you didn't know\" (e.g., \"5 Surprising Facts About Radiology Jobs in 2025\")
     * Actionable \"How-to\" guides (e.g., \"How to Land Your Dream Radiology Job in 2024\")
     * Timely insights (e.g., \"4 Ways AI is Revolutionizing Radiology Careers This Year\")
     * Career hacks or quick tips (e.g., \"6 Quick Tips to Stand Out in Radiology Interviews\")
     * Bold statements or controversial viewpoints (e.g., \"Why Traditional Radiology Jobs Might Disappear by 2030\")
     * Current trends or emerging specializations (e.g., \"3 Hot Radiology Specialties Everyone's Talking About in 2025\")

2. **SEO Focused (Search Engine Optimization)**:
   - Emphasize clear, relevant keywords like \"radiology,\" \"medical imaging,\" and related terms.
   - Include years (e.g., 2024, 2025) or clear industry-specific keywords.
   - Use straightforward language for improved search engine visibility.
   - Prefer how-to guides, insight articles, or direct informative titles.
   - Mix various SEO-friendly title formats including:
     * How-to guides (e.g., \"How to Find the Best Radiology Jobs in 2025\")
     * Career paths (e.g., \"Top Radiology Career Paths for Medical Imaging Professionals in 2024\")
     * Market outlooks (e.g., \"Radiology Job Market Outlook: Trends and Opportunities in 2025\")
     * Salary guides (e.g., \"The Ultimate Guide to Radiology Salaries and Job Benefits in 2024\")
     * Certification and qualifications (e.g., \"Radiology Certification: Requirements and Career Advantages in 2024\")
     * Step-by-step application processes (e.g., \"Step-by-Step Guide to Applying for Radiology Jobs Online in 2025\")
     * Location-specific insights (e.g., \"Radiology Jobs by State: Highest-Paying Locations for Radiologists in 2025\")

If more than one title is requested, provide a mix of both High Engagement and SEO-focused titles.

IMPORTANT: Format your response as a numbered list of ONLY the titles, nothing else. Do not add any descriptions or explanations.`
